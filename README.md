# Final-Project
Creating DowntownFashion.net website

The team consisted of David Do and Ashley Fagaragan. As a team we planned, designed and developed a website for the company, Downtown Fashion, to revive their website for users to have online access to information and to
purchase outfit designs online. The website will focus on the interactions with users and hope that the company will get more recognition.
